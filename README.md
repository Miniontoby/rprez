# MDPrez

A(n eventually) markdown based presentation software. This project separates the creation of a presentation with the delivery of a presentation, and (so far?) this project only handles the delivery of presentation. It's name will probably change because I'm bad at naming things.

This project came to fruition thanks to some conversations and insight from the amazing [@nnja](https://github.com/nnja)! You should check out her other work.

This project is still very early in its development, documentation coming soon!
